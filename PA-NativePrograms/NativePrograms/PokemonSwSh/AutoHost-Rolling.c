//
//  Non-digit characters (such as spaces or hyphen) will be skipped.
//
//  "RANDOM_DIGITS" specifies how many of the first digits are randomized.
//  If it is less than 8, the remaining digits will be copies of the last digit.
//  This makes it easier to enter the code.
//
//  When using random codes, "RAID_CODE" is used to generate the starting seed.

//  The idea here is to roll forward from the save frame to the shiny frame.
//  Once on the shiny frame (with the desired softlock), you enter and exit the
//  camp to setup a backup save on the shiny frame. That way, you can load the

//  Alternate Games: (experimental feature)
//      If set to true, alternate between games 1 and 2.
//  Basically if you have both Sword and Shield on the same user and you wish
//  to host dens on both with the same settings. This implies that at least of
//  the games must be a digital copy since you cannot have 2 carts in at once.
