/*  Pokemon Sword & Shield: US Date Skipper (7k)
 * 
 *  From: https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Arduino-Source
 * 
 *      Please refer to the user manual for instructions and documentation.
 * 
 *  This is the US version of the 7k skipper that at about 7100 skips/hour.
 * 
 *  This program is slower than the JPN skipper. So if you're doing long skips,
 *  you'll still want to change your Switch language to Japanese.
