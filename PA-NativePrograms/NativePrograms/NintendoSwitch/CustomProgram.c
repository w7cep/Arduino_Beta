/*  Pokemon Sword & Shield: Custom Program

//
//  This is a template making your own program. The example here is a copy/paste
//  of the TurboA program. Feel free to modify accordingly.
//
//  Every program that is fully integrated into the package has 4 files:
//      1.  NativePrograms/PokemonSwShPrograms/ProgramName.h
//      2.  NativePrograms/ProgramName.c
//      3.  NativePrograms/ProgramName_Core.c
//      4.  GeneratorConfig/ProgramName.json
//
//  The program is then referenced by the following files/scripts:
//      1.  NativePrograms/Scripts/BuildAll.cmd
//      2.  NativePrograms/Scripts/BuildAllUnix.sh
//      3.  GeneratorConfig/ProgramList.txt
//
//  Thus to add a new program, you must edit all of the above.
//

#include "Programs/CustomProgram.h"


//  Setting definitions and defaults go here.
